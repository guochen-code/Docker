containers are usually immutable and ephemeral
immutable infrastructure: only re-deploy containers, never change
this is the ideal scenario, but what about databases, or unique data?
docker gives us features to ensure these "separation of concerns"
this is known as "persistent data"

two solutions: volumes and bind mounts
volumes: make special location outside of container UFS
bind mounts: link container path to host path
