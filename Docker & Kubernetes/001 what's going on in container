docker container run -it -> start new container interactively
docker container exec -it -> run additional command in existing container

docker container run -it proxy nginx bash # bash shell if run with -it, it will give you a terminal inside the running container
# you will get into a container
ls -al
-> return all the files inside the container, which is based on nginx image
# from here, can change config files and download packages from internet
exit # to get out # this will also stop the container

docker container run -it --name ubuntu ubuntu # mini version of ubuntu because it is in a container but in a virtual machine, miss some softwares
apt-get update
apt-get install -y curl
curl google
exit

docker container start -ai ubuntu # curl can still be used when restart the container

# what if we want to see the shell inside a running contianer that's already running something like mySQL or nginx
docker container exec -it <container name> bash
ps aux
(ps command is no longer included in the mysql image by default. you can install it once you are in the container with 'apt-get update&&apt-get install -y procps')
