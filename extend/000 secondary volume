# Use the lsblk -f command to get information about all of the devices attached to the instance.

sudo lsblk -f

# The FSTYPE column shows the file system type for each device. If the column is empty for a specific device, it means that the device does not have a file system.
# If you have an empty volume, use the mkfs -t command to create a file system on the volume.

sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/sdf

# If you get an error that mkfs.xfs is not found, use the following command to install the XFS tools and then repeat the previous command:

sudo yum install xfsprogs

# Use the mkdir command to create a mount point directory for the volume. The mount point is where the volume is located in the file system tree and 
# where you read and write files to after you mount the volume. The following example creates a directory named /data.

sudo mkdir /data

# Use the following command to mount the volume at the directory you created in the previous step.
sudo mount /dev/sdf /data

# The mount point is not automatically preserved after rebooting your instance. To automatically mount this EBS volume after reboot
