# look at my running images:
docker ps
-> no container running, because we just built our image
# you can use image to start multiple containers

dokcer images
-> show a list of docker images

# containerize/run the image
docker run -p 5000:5000 rf-api # port of the host machine binds with the port of my docker machine
-> error: unsupported pickle protocal tree here

reasnon: 
local machine python 3, but
docker has python 2 version, not support
change base image:

FROM continuumio/anaconda3:4.4.0 # 3 is for python3

rebuild image:
docker build -t rf-api
docker run -p 5000:5000 rf-api

---> sitll not working
# specify the host in the code

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
# rebuild the image and run

# so when we see app.run() with default setting, it actually comes to be localhost and localhost and ip address inside a docker networking environment is 
not recoganizable to our host environment,  which is our local machine
# because we use local machine'web browser to open the url

summary:
if 0.0.0.0 not working
try 192.168.99.100
windows is always a bit of a problem in the sense it depends on what ip the docker vm is getting assinged.
either it will be localhost, or 192.168.99.100. in case you can't access, using both.
get to know the ip address assinged to the docker vm from your docker installation setting.

"docker-machine ip" -> get the appropriate IP
